👋 Hi, I'm @Yamparala-Venkata-Gopi
💻 Founding Engineer | Full Stack Development | ML Systems | API Security
🚀 I'm passionate about building scalable enterprise systems, with over 3 years of experience in full-stack development and cloud infrastructure. I specialize in optimizing system performance and building enterprise-grade applications that have contributed to projects valued at over $1.5M.
👀 Currently at Levo.ai, I'm focused on revolutionizing API security through innovative solutions. From implementing agentless API discovery to migrating services for 45% better performance, I love tackling challenges that push systems to perform better.
🌱 Previously at IndiaMART, I architected ML systems achieving 99.9% uptime and reduced response times by 62.5% through innovative caching solutions. My expertise spans from deploying containerized ML models to building high-performance APIs that handle millions of queries.
💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on projects that challenge conventional thinking, whether it's building scalable architectures, optimizing system performance, or creating innovative solutions that make a real impact.
📫 You can reach me at vgopi.yamparala@gmail.com or connect with me on LinkedIn. Always excited to discuss tech, share ideas, or explore new opportunities.
