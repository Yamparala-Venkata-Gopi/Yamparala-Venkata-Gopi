### 👨‍💻 About me

I’m a software engineer who enjoys working on things that sit in the hot path — APIs, runtime behavior, observability, and security.

Most of my work lately has been around understanding **what systems actually do in production**, not just what we think they do. I enjoy debugging weird edge cases, building internal tools, and making invisible problems visible.

I’m happiest in early-stage environments where things are still taking shape and there’s room to experiment, break things, and rebuild them better.

### 🧠 What I enjoy working on

- Backend systems and APIs  
- Runtime observability & traffic analysis  
- Practical security problems (not just theory)  
- Developer tooling (CLIs, internal platforms)  
- Performance and bottleneck hunting  

If it’s something engineers rely on every day, I’m probably interested.

### 🛠 Languages & tools I use often

<p align="left">
Python · Go · TypeScript · FastAPI · Flask · GraphQL · Docker · Kubernetes · AWS · GCP · Kafka · Redis · Postgres · eBPF
</p>

(I care more about *why* and *when* to use tools than memorizing lists.)

### 🌱 What I’m learning / exploring

- Deeper runtime introspection  
- API behavior under real traffic  
- Agentic tooling for debugging and testing  
- Ways to make systems easier to reason about at 2am

### 📊 GitHub

Most of my day-to-day work lives in private repos, so public stats don’t show everything — this space is mostly for experiments, side projects, and ideas I want to try in the open.
