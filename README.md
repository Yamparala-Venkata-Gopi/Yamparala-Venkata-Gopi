👋 Hi, I’m @Venkata-Gopi-Personal-Projects 💻 Senior Software Engineer | Gen AI | Backend Development | Data Infrastructure | Machine Learning

🚀 I’m passionate about driving innovation through technology, with over 3 years of experience in backend development, data engineering, and machine learning. I specialize in designing scalable solutions that address complex challenges, from optimizing data pipelines to deploying AI-powered applications on cloud platforms.

👀 I’m deeply interested in experimenting with Large Language Models (LLMs), using tools like LangChain and vector databases to build AI-driven solutions that push the possible boundaries. My current focus is on enhancing user interactions with BIM models through NLP and LLM integration.

🌱 I’m continuously exploring cloud-native technologies, container orchestration, and advanced machine-learning frameworks to stay at the forefront of technology. My goal is to blend cutting-edge tools with practical applications, making innovative ideas a reality.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that challenge the status quo, whether it's optimizing system performance, developing new ML-driven tools, or scaling platforms that deliver impactful solutions.

📫 You can reach me at vgopi.yamparala@gmail.com or connect with me on LinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/in/venkata1b21131a5/) . I'm always open to discussing new opportunities, sharing ideas, or exploring potential collaborations.
